# 🌐 LLM-based Disaster Detection Using Live CCTV

## 📌 What This Project Does

This project enables the detection and interpretation of environmental threats (e.g., floods, infrastructure risks) by leveraging large language models (LLMs) and multimodal inputs derived from CCTV-based river surveillance feeds.  
Key features include:

- 🔍 Disaster keyword extraction from time-lapse CCTV imagery  
- 🧠 Semantic analysis of frame descriptions via LLMs  
- 🧮 Disaster scoring & severity classification  
- 📄 Report generation for civic response and public sharing (e.g., LinkedIn-ready summaries)

## 💡 Why This Project Is Useful

- 📸 Utilizes publicly available surveillance feeds (e.g., Japanese MLIT river cameras)  
- ⏱ Captures periodic frames instead of real-time streams — ideal for bandwidth-efficient monitoring  
- 🏙️ Supports municipal decision-making by transforming visual data into structured reports  
- 🌐 Bridges LLM reasoning with on-the-ground environmental observations  
- 🤝 Enables transparency & public communication through explainable outputs
